This was my final dashboard: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/odefe-oberabor-a866a2226_datadna-activity-7076690329420087296-QQzT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

Below is my thought process throughput for analyzing the data:

Created Table from Excel Sheet.
Noticed 2028 in Cleanup date...unsure if it was meant to be 2018 0r 2008. Deleted so it doesn't skew results.
Another date was 0218-04-20... seems like a typographical error. Changed it to 2018

Imported The Excel File to SQL Management Studio.

After importing I had to change some datatypes
Changed all data types with integers from float to integer. Columns include ID, Adults, Children and any column involving Trash Data
	
Changed ID datatype from float to INT
Changed Zone datatype from nvarchar(255) to nvarchar(80)
Changed State datatype from nvarchar(255) to nvarchar(50)
Changed Country datatype from nvarchar(255) to nvarchar(14)
Changed GPS_Lat datatype from float to DECIMAL(18,8)
Changed GPS_Long datatype from float to DECIMAL(11,8)
Changed Cleanup Type datatype from [nvarchar](255) to [nvarchar](48)
Changed Cleanup Date datatype from date time to date
Normalized the data creating tables for groups, location & clean up events and trash collected.

Explored the Trash Data
Total Number of Pounds: 11780214.60 
Total Number of Pounds per State: Top 3 states: California, Pensylvania & Texas.
Total Number of Pounds per Zone: Top 3 zones: San Diego County, CA, USA (476912.56) & Hills borough County, FL, USA (445976.84)

Next I wanted to calculate the average Trash Per Cleanup:
I realized a lot of pounds have 0 as their weight, this may not necessarily be an inaccuracy as sweet wrappers and straws I recon don't weigh much.
But after more scrutiny of the data a lot of rows with '0pounds' had walked a lot of miles and picked up a lot of trash and still had 0 pounds.
My conclusion:
Some Pickup days actually had 0 pounds at the end of the day.
Some didn't measure their weight.
Some were inaccurate entries.
Due to this uncertainty around the pounds. I decided to calculate the average only for clean up days when the pounds was more than 0.


I calculated the most common clean up type
I calculated the most active groups
I calculated the most common type of trash.


Copied the results to excel for visualization

Created multiple connections as the spreadsheets mostly didn't have similar columns.
In the data, Tableau didn't accept the location format they wanted Alabama instead of Alabama, USA, etc.
So i used the LEFT Function in excel to separate the ", USA" from each location.
The Formula I Used: =LEFT(A2, FIND(",", A2, 1)-1).
It worked in the excel file but didn't reflect on my tableau, I guess because I was already using it as a data source, not sure.
Decided to create a calculated field using SPLIT.
SPLIT([State], ",", 1)
Changed the datatype to state.

Had to do the same for Zones.
But slightly different formula.
TRIM(SPLIT([zone], 'County', 1))
Changed the datatype to county
I wanted to visualize Zones on the map but realized the zones were too small to show well
especially as the zones are all across the united states.
I decided to show it on a tree map.
